                <h1>Case Study: Building a Knowledge Library for Hotel Superbrain's AI</h1>
                
                <ul class="project-meta">
                    <li><strong>Client:</strong> Hotel Superbrain (USA-Based AI Startup)</li>
                    <li><strong>Role:</strong> Freelance Data Specialist</li>
                    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> June, 2025 (15-Day Contract)</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Google Search, ChatGPT, Google Sheets</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>Hotel Superbrain needed to build a foundational knowledge library for its generative AI. My task was to execute targeted research queries, gather relevant documents (PDFs), and transform the unstructured information into a clean, organized dataset of over 2,500 records that the AI could learn from.</p>

                <h2>My Contribution: A 3-Step Workflow</h2>
                <ol class="workflow-list">
                    <li>
                        <h3>Sourcing & Collection</h3>
                        <p>Based on specific query tasks, I performed advanced searches to identify and collect high-authority documents. The focus was on quality and relevance to ensure the AI was trained on expert-level information.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>AI-Assisted Extraction & Summarization</h3>
                        <p>This was the core of the process. For each document, I leveraged ChatGPT to extract key data points and synthesize complex information into concise, structured formats, dramatically increasing efficiency and consistency.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Structuring & Handoff</h3>
                        <p>I meticulously populated the extracted data into a shared Google Sheet. A critical feature I included was a column with a direct download link for each source PDF, which optimized the data ingestion workflow for the engineering team and ensured a seamless project handoff.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    <figcaption>An anonymized look at the final dataset, structured for easy ingestion by the AI model.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                <p>The final deliverable was a robust, well-organized knowledge library of over 2,500 records. This work served as a critical building block for the Hotel Superbrain AI, enhancing its reasoning capabilities and enabling the team to accelerate the development pipeline.</p>
